Write a LangGraph deep research agent. First, it should have a back and forth with the user using terminal to clarify the scope of the research. When done and confident to move forward, it should pass that to a ReAct Agent. The ReAct agent should have a search tool. I want you to use Tavily for it. The ReAct agent should use the brief that is generated to call tools if necessary and generate a detailed report that is returned to the user. The agent should be deployable on Langgraph platform.
